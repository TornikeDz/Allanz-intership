        title: "It Was Once the Ninth Planet",
        description: "Pluto was considered the ninth planet in our solar system from its discovery in 1930 until 2006, when the International Astronomical Union reclassified it as a 'dwarf planet.'"
    },
    {
        title: "Tiny but Far Away",
        description: "Pluto is relatively small compared to Earth. In fact, it's even smaller than Earth's moon. Its diameter is about 2,377 kilometers (1,479 miles). It is also extremely distant, with an average distance from the Sun of about 5.9 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles)."
    },
    {
        title: "It Has Five Known Moons",
        description: "Pluto has five moons, with the largest being Charon. The others are Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Charon is so large relative to Pluto that they actually orbit a common center of mass, known as the 'barycenter,' that lies outside of Pluto."
    },
    {
        title: "Its Orbit Is Elliptical",
        description: "Pluto’s orbit is elliptical (oval-shaped) and is tilted compared to the orbits of the other planets. This means that its distance from the Sun varies significantly over the course of its 248-year orbit. Sometimes it’s closer to the Sun than Neptune!"
    },
    {
        title: "Very Cold",
        description: "Pluto is extremely cold, with temperatures averaging around -225°C (-373°F). This makes it one of the coldest places in the solar system. Its atmosphere, made mostly of nitrogen, is thin and freezes and expands depending on its position in its orbit."
    },
    {
        title: "Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh",
        description: "Pluto was discovered by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. He used a technique called 'blink comparison' to detect it."
    },
    {
        title: "The Name 'Pluto'",
        description: "The name 'Pluto' was suggested by an 11-year-old girl from Oxford, England, named Venetia Burney. It was chosen after the Roman god of the underworld, in reference to its distant, cold location. The name also honored Percival Lowell, whose observatory had predicted the existence of a ninth planet."
    },
    {
        title: "A Changing Atmosphere",
        description: "Pluto’s atmosphere is primarily nitrogen with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. As it moves closer to the Sun during its orbit, the atmosphere can expand and become more substantial, while when it moves farther away, it can freeze and collapse."
    },
    {
        title: "A 'Heart' on Its Surface",
        description: "One of Pluto’s most famous features is the large, heart-shaped area on its surface known as 'Tombaugh Regio,' named in honor of its discoverer. This region is composed of nitrogen ice and is one of the most recognizable features in images of Pluto."
    },
    {
        title: "New Horizons Mission",
        description: "The NASA New Horizons spacecraft made history in 2015 by performing a flyby of Pluto, providing the first close-up images and data about the dwarf planet. The mission helped to dramatically increase our understanding of Pluto, revealing surprising features like mountains made of water ice and vast plains of nitrogen ice."
    },
    {
        title: "Pluto’s Day",
        description: "A day on Pluto lasts about 6.4 Earth days, as it takes this long for Pluto to rotate once on its axis."
    },
    {
        title: "Cultural Impact",
        description: "Pluto’s reclassification as a dwarf planet sparked debate and a mix of reactions. Many people, especially those who grew up learning Pluto was a planet, were disappointed by the decision."
